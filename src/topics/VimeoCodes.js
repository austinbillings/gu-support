    <p>If you purchased the first-pressing of the Bokanté album on CD or vinyl, you received a card that gives you complimentary access to a digital edition of the Bokanté video. The card will look similar to this one:</p>
    <img src="assets/bokante-cards.png" alt="Photo of Bokante Video Cards" />
    <p>On the reverse of the card, you’ll see a URL that begins with <code>https://vimeo.com/</code>. This is the code that you’ll type into your web browser, but don’t do it yet!</p>

    <p>The Bokanté video is provided by our streaming partner, Vimeo. If you don’t already have one, you’ll need to register an account before you can redeem the code. That way, you’ll be able to watch the video as many times as you like! Register an account by going to the Vimeo home page and clicking the Join button in the upper left corner.</p>
    <p>Once you’ve joined, don’t log out! Jut type in the URL on the Bokanté complimentary card and you’ll be taken to a page allowing you to redeem the code. Be sure you’ve typed in the URL correctly! If you mistype it, you’ll get an error page. So just try again.</p>
